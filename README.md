This is a repository for helping friends and family to learn how to code things.

This is one of the most simple programs that you can write.
```dart
main() {
   print('hello');
}
```
All programs start somewhere, and run a set of instructions one at a time, until the program finishes.

The first bit creates a `function` called `main`.
A function is a way to combine a sequence of instructions into one instruction.

This function called `main` is the first instruction that runs in any program.

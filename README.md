This is a repository for helping friends and family to learn how to code things.

This is one of the most simple programs that you can write.

Example 1:
```dart
main() {
   print('hello');
}
```
All programs start somewhere, and run a set of instructions one at a time, until the program finishes.

The first bit creates a `function` called `main`.
A function is a way to combine a sequence of instructions into one instruction.

This function called `main` is the first instruction that runs in any program.

A function consists of a name then a set of parentheses and then an open and closing brace.

Example 2:
```dart
aName() {}
```

In programming all names have to start with a letter or underscore, and can only contain letters, underscores, and numbers.

Usually names start with a lowercase letter, and since you can't use spaces programmers usually separate the words with uppercase letters for each new word.

Example 3:
```dart
aVeryLongNameSeparatedByUppercaseLettersAndWithNumbers11001010102939458568
```

Typically we keep names short though.

Functions have both inputs and an output. Simple functions don't have any inputs or outputs.
The function main is simple like that.

Data in programs are made up of a couple of types.
* Numbers can be two types:
   * `int` an integer 
   * `double` numbers with decimal places
* A sequence of letters called a string
   * `string`
